News for You: Personalized News Aggregator

I. Introduction
The overwhelming volume of news content, spanning local, international, sports, and entertainment topics, makes it difficult for users to track information relevant to their interests. With numerous sources and subjects to choose from, users often struggle to filter through the contents, leading to an unsatisfactory news consumption experience. As many news websites rapidly becomes available, it becomes challenging to determine which sources are most reliable and credible on a given topic. To address this, we aim to create a Personalized News Aggregator that will help users filter and find news that is relevant to their specific interests. Moreover, in partnership with “Future Business Teachers’ Organization”, we will work side by side to build a platform that bridges seamless information while fostering awareness and engagement through a user-curated experience


II. Problem Statement and Objectives


•  Develop the user information and database for users to login or register their accounts to use
the website.
• Develop a user preference/filter system which allows the user to select their preferences in
terms of news content
• Integrate the News API to retrieve news articles and apply the filtering system based on the
chosen preferences of the user. Furthermore, metadata will be used for better filtering
• The website will ensure that the system is updated in terms of news contents through the
display of timestamps for article updates.
• Implement a filtering system and search bar.
• The website will support multi-platform accessibility. We will use JavaScript, HTML, and
PHP.
• Implement a bookmarking feature to save articles that users would like to read again.
• Implement a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to hover through and use the
website.

IV. Scope of the Project
The final result of this project will be a fully functional Personalized News Aggregator website, which will allow users to register, log in, set their news preferences, filter articles, search for content, bookmark articles, and receive real-time news updates. The website will be built using JavaScript, HTML, and PHP, and will be accessible across multiple platforms. 


The development process will begin with creating a user authentication system for login and registration, followed by setting up the database using PHP and XAMPP. The integration of a news API will be done through https://www.thenewsapi.com/ to provide free, worldwide news, and a filtering system will be implemented based on user preferences such as Local, International, Sports, and Entertainment news. Metadata will also be applied to improve filtering accuracy.


The user interface will be designed to be responsive, utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and a theme will be chosen for the website's design. Functionalities will include a search bar for keyword-based filtering, a bookmarking feature for saving read articles, and the display of timestamps for real-time news updates. 


Finally, the website will undergo thorough testing and debugging while working closely with the client to ensure all features work as expected, including cross-platform testing to ensure compatibility across different devices and systems.
